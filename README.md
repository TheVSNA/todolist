# todolist
The purpose of this project is to build a website to manage a todo list.
The website page is inspired by [todoist.com](todoist.com) .
The main page has some buttons that are only for aesthetics (at least for the moment), but the functions to create a todo list, create a todo element and visualize the elements based on the date or the group they belong to, are implemented.
This website only use html + css + js for frontend and nodejs for backend.
The backend part also has the (commented) code to connect to a db.
To test:
1. clone the repository
2. on a terminal digit
```
node index.js
```
3. open your browser on localhost:80
